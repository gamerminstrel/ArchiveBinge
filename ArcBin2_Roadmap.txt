so let's think for a minute. How can I use python to find web-pages?
If I know the name of a website, I can read it.
example site:
https://centralia2050.com/comic-archive/
http://www.altar-girl.com/archive.html
https://comic.galebound.com/comic/archive

ArcBin 2.0 requirements:
-Python 3
-Must be able to scan a website to find all pages of its webcomic.
-Scan archive page
    -parse for URLs to pages

short term goal:
using comic.galebound.com/archive, make a python script that will find the URL to each page of the comic

#Install required modules and packages
sudo apt install python3-venv
